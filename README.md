# Amazon Affiliate Link Localize

### Description

This plugin automatically changes your Amazon links to point to your visitor's local Amazon store whilst using your affiliate ID for that country.

This plugin not only automatically changes any Amazon link on your site to use your affiliate ID, but it also changes the link to point to the user's local Amazon store. So if your visitor is visiting from the UK they'll get a link to Amazon.co.uk, if they're visiting from the US they'll get a link to the same product on Amazon.com.
All you have to do is provide all your affiliate IDs. It doesn't matter if the link is in your post, in your template or anywhere else on your page - it'll be converted automatically.

### Disclosure

If you don't have an affiliate account with one of the Amazon countries and leave its setting blank, the script will use mine. It'll never overwrite your affiliate IDs though, so don't worry - you'll never lose any revenue.

### Installation

1. Upload the `amazon_affiliate_link_localizer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enter your Affiliate IDs under the settings page

### Non-Wordpress version

If you want to achieve the same result on a non-Wordpress site, you can simply install the [JavaScript version](http://petewilliams.info/blog/2009/07/javascript-amazon-associate-link-localiser)
