This plugin changes any Amazon links on your site to use your affiliate ID. It also changes the link to point to the user's local Amazon store.

== Description ==
This plugin not only automatically changes any Amazon link on your site to use your affiliate ID, but it also changes the link to point to the user's local Amazon store. 

So if you're visitor is visiting form the UK they'll get a link to Amazon.co.uk, if they're visiting from the US they'll get a link to the same product on Amazon.com.

All you have to do is provide all your affiliate IDs.

It doesn't matter if the link is in your post, in your template or anywhere else on your page - it'll be converted automatically.

== Non-Wordpress version ==
If you want to achieve the same result on a non-Wordpress site, you can simply install the [JavaScript version](http://petewilliams.info/blog/2009/07/javascript-amazon-associate-link-localiser)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `amazon_affiliate_link_localizer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
